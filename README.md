We are creating a mobile phone application that reduces excessive mobile phone dependence in a friendly way by allowing students to achieve their goals and giving them rewards for achieving their goals.

We have used POD files and Google's Firebase to create this application in XCODE
please see https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html and https://firebase.google.com

## TO EDIT: 

please use 'Excessive-dependence-solution.workspace' to add any modifications.
